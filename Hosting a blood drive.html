                Provides a suitable location.
                 A large, open space is best, so we can create separate zones for conducting confidential eligibility assessments and collecting donations.
                 Organizes a recruitment committee to recruit donors. 
                 Face-to-face requests are the most effective form of recruitment. 
                 Don’t do this alone; build a team to help spread the word. 
                 Publicizes the blood drive.
                  The more people who know about your blood drive – both within your organization and in the community – the more donors you can sign up.  
                  Schedules donors for appointments.
                   Plus, you’ll do follow ups during the drive to ensure donors don’t miss their appointments, and reach out afterward to say thank you.
