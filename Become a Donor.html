            <h1>How do I donate plasma?</h1>
            <p>
                When you enter a Plasma donation center for the first time, our staff will ask you to provide a valid form of identification, proof of residency and proof of your social security number.
                 Next, you will answer some questions. Then our medical staff will review your medical history and conduct a physical examination (check your vitals) to verify your eligibility as a donor.
                  Once all eligibility requirements have been met, you will begin the process of donating your plasma.
                 Upon completion of your first plasma donation, you will receive your payment on a reloadable prepaid card.
            </p>
            <h2>How long will my first plasma donation take?</h2>
            <p>
                Wait times can vary by location.
                 Your first donation usually takes between 2 to 2 ½ hours, which includes a health assessment.
                 Subsequent donations generally take about 1 to 1 ½ hours
            </p>
            <h3>How does plasma collection work?</h3>
            <p>
                We collect your plasma using a process called plasmapheresis that separates the plasma from the blood and collects it in a bottle.
                 We use a sophisticated machine that safely collects the plasma and returns the other parts of the blood back to you.
            </p>
            <h4>What safety procedures are in place?</h4>
            <p>
                Plasma centers have been deemed an essential business and have remained open during the COVID-19 pandemic.
                 Because we’re committed to your health and safety, we’ve implemented a number of COVID-19 plasma donation protocols.
